# Dwindle
 
This project is created during the GMTK Game Jam 2024.

Game is about building yourself a way using the toys in a kids room to reach a high place and using this way by getting smaller.

Implemented an interaction system to handle grab and rotate the objects however the player wants.

Implemented a portal system to create a seemless shrinking effect.

You can download and play the game for yourself by clicking [here](https://gusullupapaz.itch.io/dwindle).
